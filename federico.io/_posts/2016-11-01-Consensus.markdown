How can networks of hundreds or thousands of robots make decisions quickly, efficiently and robustly? How much time, battery power and wireless bandwidth is required to reach an agreement in a robotic swarm?

Our research explores the fundamental performance limitations of distributed consensus and the tradeoffs between time complexity, message and byte complexity (both proxies to battery usage), bandwidth complexity and robustness of algorithms for decentralized decision-making.
Applications include leader election, data fusion and distributed optimization in robotic networks.
