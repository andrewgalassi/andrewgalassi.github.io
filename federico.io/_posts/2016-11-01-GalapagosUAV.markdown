In collaboration with [Universidad San Francisco de Quito][usfqlink], we worked on the design, construction and deployment of a swarm of UAVs to protect sharks in the Galapagos Marine Reserve from illegal poaching.

Our contribution included design of deployment algorithms for dynamic coverage and  hardware and software design of the communication subsystem to robustly transmit images and videos in real-time from the planes to a ground station. The project is currently in a hiatus (but sharks in the Galapagos are protected by a [new marine sanctuary][natgeolink]!).
