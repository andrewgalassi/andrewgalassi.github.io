# So you want to buy a telescope

I used to lead the [Stanford Astronomical Society](orion.stanford.edu), and I was often asked for advice about good beginner telescopes.

Here is some of that advice.

- for $400-$500, get an 8'' Dobsonian by Orion (XT8) or Zhumell (Z8). It has no electronics, so you invest all of the budget in larger optics.
- if you have a slightly higher budget, consider a 10'' Dobsonian.
- encoders which tell you where you are looking for are nice to have, but they do not replace having more light.
- if you do not have space, or if you will be doing primarily planetary, I am quite fond of small tabletop Mak-Cass telescopes (e.g. Skywatcher Virtuoso). They are terrible for deep sky (galaxies, nebulae, etc.), though.
- if you want to do imaging, none of the telescopes above work - it is a different conversation and a rather different price point.
- get the book "Turn Left at Orion" by Guy Consolmagno with your first telescope. It will tell you _where_ to look, and it is a wonderful companion.
- as a starter/if you are unsure about the hobby, it is hard to beat a pair of 10x50 binoculars (Celestron makes good ones) and a dark sky. The 15x70 binoculars by Celestron are also very good and a favorite of many astronomers, but they require a tripod, so I don't like them as much.

## Aperture is king

In astronomy, the size of your primary mirror (aperture) matters a lot. Many interesting objects in the sky are not small: the Andromeda Galaxy is 3 degrees across, six times wider than the Moon! Interesting object are _faint_: the main purpose of a telescope is to gather light across the primary aperture and concentrate it on your pupil.

Some objects (namely, planets) are really small. But, even then, aperture rules. A good [rule of thumb](https://www.cloudynights.com/topic/609373-maximum-magnification-by-aperture/) is that the maximum magnification that will yield reasonabky good views on a telescope is between 30X and 50X the telescope aperture in inches. A 4'' telescope can be pushed to 200X, but an 8'' will go to 400X and resolve a lot more detail on planetary surfaces. 

So, for visual astronomy, you want to spend as much as possible on aperture. Dobsonian telescopes are designed for this: they are a simple Newtonian telescope on a mount that is as cheap as can be, so you can get more aperture for the money. The downsides of Dobsonians (or Dobs) are that:

- you do not get a tracking mount, so you need to follow objects manually in the sky as they move - and Jupiter moves surprisingly fast at 400X;

- you do not get encoders, so you need to find things in the sky by star-hopping and using the low-power finder, which is a learned art;

- Dobsonian telescopes do not work for deep-sky imaging (although you can get pretty awesome planetary images);

- the image quality is somewhat lower compared to other optical designs; in particular, stars at the edges of the field of view will be "smeared" due to coma.

- Dobsonians are somewhat bulky compared to other optical designs (although there are [collapsible Dobsonians](http://skywatcher.com/product/bk-dob-10-collapsible/) and, for larger optics, [truss Dobs](http://www.hubbleoptics.com/UL16.html) that can be taken apart for transportation and storage. 

This said, the very best visual observing sessions I have enjoyed were through a [16'' Dobsonian](http://www.hubbleoptics.com/UL16.html) under a dark sky. With more aperture, you can just see things that would be too faint for the eye otherwise.

## Finding things in the sky

Finding stuff is nontrivial, especially at high power. But it is a lot of fun! Roaming the Milky Way is pretty awesome. 
Get the book Turn Left at Orion, it will walk you through finding targets. I also find a zero-magnification finder such as a Telrad to be invaluable.
If you can fit encoders or GoTo into your budget, they _are_ awesome. But they do not replace having more light.
There are after-market DIY encoder solutions - I use one with great success.

## Binoculars

Yes, aperture matters. But you will not be lugging an 8'' to the PCT. Binoculars are really awesome, especially under a dark sky, and they are great for learning how to star-hop. Binoculars have two numbers: the first one is maginfication, the second one is aperture. Magnification above 10/15X cannot be handheld, so you need a tripod, which defeats the purpose. I use a 10x50. Celestron's 15x70 are very highly regarded but I found them a bit too heavy.

## Astrophotography

Begin with visual and a webcam or planetary cam. For deep-sky imaging, it is a different story. Invest on the mount, the telescope almost does not matter. A lot of astrophoto is also about post-processing (which can be nice if you live in a place where skies are cloudy a lot). If you want to dip your toes in post-processing before investing in an imaging rig, there are lots of freely-available datasets. You can also subscribe to a service such as iTelescope to use state-of-the-art imaging rigs without having to set them up, align them, etc.



## Other fun astronony activities

### Outreach

### ISS Imaging

### Radio Astronomy

All of these come in slightly under your budget: avenues for improvement include (i) push-to controls, so you can know what you're pointing at (this is marketed as "Intelliscope" by Orion...if you're mechanically minded, there are DIY solutions too) and (ii) a 10'' Dobsonian instead, e.g. the Zhumell Z10 or Orion XT10 (in telescopes, aperture is king).

Also, I highly recommend the book "Turn left at Orion" by Guy Consolmagno. It's a great and surprisingly comprehensive beginner's guide to deep sky objects.

If you are space-constrained, I'd steer you towards a computerized Mak-Cass (e.g. this Meade) instead. You'll be giving up a lot of light-gathering capability, so you'll be limited to planets and clusters, but you would get a much more portable package and computerized controls (GoTo) thrown in.
