I was the Teaching Assistant for Stanford’s [Optimal Control and Introduction to Dynamic Optimization](http://explorecourses.stanford.edu/search?view=catalog&filter-coursestatus-Active=on&q=AA%20203:%20Introduction%20to%20Optimal%20Control%20and%20Dynamic%20Optimization&academicYear=20162017) class (AA 203) in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

AA 203 includes a large final project: I immensely enjoyed advising students on projects including [identifying the root cause of mobility impairment in patients suffering from stroke](https://doi.org/10.1101/139857), controlling flexible surgical robots and tensegrity structures, and computing maximum-drift trajectories for Marty, Stanford’s self-driving DeLorean.

I have also been very fortunate to mentor a number of brilliant high school, undergraduate, and graduate students who participated in internships with the Autonomous Systems Lab and with JPL, and in the the [Alta Scuola Politecnica](http://www.asp-poli.it/)'s alumni mentoring program.

Past and current mentees include:

* Quinn Wu (Gunn High School), now at UPenn 
* Ivan Maric (UC Berkeley), now at UCSD 
* Luke Shimanuki (Amador Valley High School), now at MIT
